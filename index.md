## QAmemBERT

[![View on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/resolve/main/model-on-hf-md.svg)](https://huggingface.co/CATIE-AQ/QAmembert)

QAmemBERT is simply the best performing QA model in French according to the benchmarks ! \
It is available in two sizes ([base](https://huggingface.co/CATIE-AQ/QAmembert) and [large](https://huggingface.co/CATIE-AQ/QAmembert-large))  and is freely available on Hugging Face. 

I gathered the data and build the scripts for training it, evaluated the results during the POC phase. It was developed in collaboration with [Lo√Øck Bourdois](https://lbourdois.github.io/) and [Boris Albar](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/boris-albar).

This is my personnal take on multimodal RAG : modern method working on pdfs at the page level, no tedious document parsing !  Runs locally.

Script for fine tuning a Multimodal Langage Model (Idefics3) in French. \
Script for fine tuning a multimodal embedding model of type ColPali.

## Efficient ML/DL presentation
[View the PDF presentation](https://github.com/pierrebedu/portfolio/blob/main/techintome_efficientML_public_version.pdf) \
Here is the link for an internal talk~workshop  I gave in 2023 to datascientists, data engineers and developers. \
Very little text, but a lot to tell and discuss! 

Include a guessing game to keep everyone attentive.

## Classify anything
WIP. Code is fully functionnal but has to be cleaned ;) \
\
State of the art, all purpose, image classifier with multiple tricks from research papers. \
(CNNs, ViTs, soft labels, TTA, quantize, schedulers and so on, all customizable) \
This script is my go-to routine.
